'''
Generic Function for BFS Traversal of a graph
(Valid for directed as well as undirected graphs
which can have multiple disconnected components)
-- Inputs --
-> V - represents number of vertices in the Graph
-> adj[] - represents adjacency list for the Graph
-> bfs_traversal - a vector containing bfs traversal

for entire graph
