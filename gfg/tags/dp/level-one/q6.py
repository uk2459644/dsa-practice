Size of array after repeated deletion of LIS

Given an array arr[0..n-1] of the positive element. The task is to print
the remaining elements of arr[] after repeated deletion of LIS (of size greater than 1).
If there are multiple LIS with the same length, we need to choose the LIS that
ends first.

"""

"""
# inputs vector array = arr[]
# max-sum LIS vector array = maxArray[]

while (arr.size()){

# find LIS 
lis=findLIS(arr,arr.size());
if(lis.size()<2):
    break
    
# Remove lis element from current array. note that both lis[] and arr[]
# are sorted in increasing order.
