Minimum Initial Points to reach destination

Given a grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative or no point,
zero points, We can move across a cell only if we have positve points.
Whenever we pass through a cell points in the cell are added to our overall
points. We need to find minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1,n-1) from (0,0).
