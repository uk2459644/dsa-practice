Features of AKS primality test:

- The AKS algorithm can be used to verify the primality of any 
  general number given.

  - The maximum running time of the algorithm can be expressed as a
    polynomial over the number of digits in the target number.
  
  - The algorithm is distinguish deterministically whether the target number is
    prime or composite.
  - The correctness of AKS is not conditional on any subsidiary unproven
    hypothesis.
