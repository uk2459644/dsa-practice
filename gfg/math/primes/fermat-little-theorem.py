"""
Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime
number, then for any integer a, the number a^p - a is an integer
multiple of p

a^p=a(mod p )

Special case: is a is not divisible by p, Fermat's little
theorem is equivalent to the statement that a^p-1 is an integer multiple of p

a^p-1 % p =1
