"""
Given three integers num1, num2, and k, tha task is
to find the count of numbers between these two numbers
such that the xor of the digit is exactly k.

"""
"""
Approach: 
- Initialize count with 0 to count the number of digits.
- Then, iterates through each number from num1 to num2.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the xor of the digits of the current 
  number.
- if xor=k then increase the counter.
- Return the value of the count.
